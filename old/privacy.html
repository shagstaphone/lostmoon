				<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
				<p>Lost Moon Radio and its parent organization Lost Moon LLC believe that privacy is an inalienable right of all sentient and self-aware beings in the known and unknown universe.  It is therefore important to us to share any elements of this site that may affect your privacy.</p>
				<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
				<p>Since May 12th, 2011, LostMoonRadio.com has used <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">Google Analytics</a> to collect data about how visitors use our site.  Google Analytics uses a first-party cookie and JavaScript code to collect visitor information including:</p>
				<p>
				1. Network location and IP address<br />
				2. Time of visit, pages visited, and time spent on each page of the website<br />
				3. Referring site statistics (such as the URI a user came through to arrive at this site or the search engine query a user entered to find this site)<br />
				4. Type of web browser<br />
				5. Type of operating system (OS)<br />
				6. Flash version, JavaScript support, screen resolution, and screen color processing ability<br />
				</p>
				<p>The data Google Analytics collects <span class="bold">DOES NOT</span> include any personalized identification information such as:</p>
				<p>
				1. Names<br />
				2. Phone numbers<br />
				3. E-mail addresses<br />
				4. Mailing addresses<br />
				5. Social Security Numbers<br />
				6. Bank Account Numbers<br />
				7. Credit Card Information<br />
				</p>
				<p>Google Analytics supplies Lost Moon LLC with regular reports that show visitor trends, which allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and optimize this site for our visitors.  These reports include only aggregate and anonymous data; Google Analytics does not report the actual IP address information of visitors to Lost Moon LLC.</p>
				<p>Google Analytics is currently the most widely used website statistics service, employed by sites both small (like ours) and large (like MySpace and Twitter).  The information it gathers is in line with that gathered by other web analytics services, and is similar to the information Google gathers every time you use the Google search engine.  (To learn more about how Google uses this information, you can read the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>.)</p>
				<p>However, we recognize that Google may well be a collection of Bond-type supervillains with a pathological determination to control all of the world's knowledge.  <span class="bold">If you'd prefer not to have information about your website visit sent to Google Analytics</span>, there are a number of ways you can opt out:</p>
				<p>1. You can disable cookies or decline the specific cookie sent by LostMoonRadio.com. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.</p>
				<p>2. You can download and install the <a target="_blank" href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>, which will prevent your information from being sent to Google Analytics by any websites you might visit.</p>
				<p>3. You can download and install any number of non-Google, open-source browser plug-ins for free, like <a target="_blank" href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://optimalcycling.com/other-projects/notscripts/">NotScripts</a>.</p>

				<h2>Topspin Widgets</h2>
				<p>LostMoonRadio.com features a number of Topspin Media "Widgets," which are interactive mini-programs we use for content distribution services (e.g. trading an email for a free song, purchasing an album, playing music, etc.). These widgets may ask you for your email address in exchange for a free song or other piece of content.  If you consent to give your email address, the Widget will subscribe you to the Lost Moon Radio mailing list (see above).  You may unsubscribe from the mailing list at any time.</p> 
				<p>Some of the Topspin Widgets may have an "Email a friend" feature. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about Lost Moon Radio or a piece of Lost Moon Radio content, we will ask you for your friend's email address. The Widget will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Topspin stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of its referral program.</p>
				<p>The Topspin Widgets also have a "share" feature. If you choose to use this share service to repost a Widget on another website, the third party website (such as Facebook) will request your login credentials (such as your Facebook password). The Widget will then automatically post the Widget on that website, which is governed by the third party website's privacy policy.</p>
				<p>Cookies may also be sent by the Topspin Widgets to enable them to function properly.  Through these cookies, Topspin Media may automatically receive and record information on its server logs from your browser including your IP address,  cookie information, the page you requested, and the media you have consumed (e.g., viewed, played, downloaded, and shared). Topspin is the data processor of the personal information collected through these Widgets.</p>
				<p>Lost Moon LLC uses the information collected by the the Topspin Widgets for promotional purposes and targeted and general fan outreach.  Topspin may provide information to us that relates to our fans (e.g., regarding which fans are consuming and sharing what pieces of media at what levels).  Topspin may also provide aggregate information to its partners about how our users, collectively, utilize Topspin's services.</p>
				<p>Data is used by Topspin and Lost Moon LLC only for the purpose for which it was intended.  Topspin will neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to other people or nonaffiliated companies.  Lost Moon Radio will not sell, share, or distribute your personal information to any third party for any purpose without your permission, unless required by law.</p>
				<p>In keeping with our general policies, it's important to us to disclose to you as fully as possible when we are collecting your information (via the Topspin Widgets or otherwise) and how we are using it.  We welcome feedback, and you may <a href="contact.html">email us</a> at any time with comments or criticism.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">If you do not wish to have any of your personal information collected</span>, you may decline to use the Topspin Widgets.  You may also wish to set your browser to disable cookies or to decline the specific cookies sent to you by the Topspin Widgets or LostMoonRadio.com.</p>
