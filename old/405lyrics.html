				<h1>"THE 405" Lyrics</h1>
				<p><span class="small">Music and Lyrics &copy;1984 Billy Freehold and the Surface Street Band</span></p>
				<p>Rollin' up to Jessie's house<br />
					In a beat-up Chevrolet<br />
					Wind through her hair is blowin' south<br />
				As if guiding us that way</p>
				<p><img class="photo float-right" src="images/405/rollingup.jpg" alt="Dan Oster" title="'Rollin' up to Jessie's house...'">
					Jessie, this machine<br />
					Can take us far away from here<br />
					We'll follow that open road<br />
				Till the city disappears</p>
				<p>Jessie, are you ready to ride?<br />
					My door is open, just climb inside<br />
					By sundown we'll be in Mexico<br />
				All right, I think we'll take the 405</p>
				<p>Who-oa...<br />
					We're gonna break this town and head out for the border<br />
					You'll wake up in my arms in Baja California<br />
					Beyond the horizon is all that we've sought<br />
				But gosh, this traffic is heavier than I thought</p>
				<p>Jessie, what do you think?<br />
					<img class="photo float-right" src="images/405/jessie.jpg" alt="Dan Oster" title="'Should I take this exit here?'">
					Should I take this exit here?<br />
					If we just get past the interchange<br />
				I know we'll be in the clear</p>
				<p>This city's tryin’ to hold us in<br />
					But babe, we're bustin' out<br />
					You know what?  Forget the freeway<br />
				We're gonna take my secret route</p>
				<p>We're gonna get off on Sawtelle<br />
					Take National for a spell<br />
					Although now it looks like some other drivers<br />
				Know this trick as well</p>
				<p>But no matter 'cause<br />
					We'll break this town and head out for the border<br />
					You'll wake up in my arms in Baja California<br />
					A wide-open country is waiting for us<br />
				If we can just get out from behind this bus</p>
				<p>The thing about woman drivers, Jessie<br />
					That makes a man wanna explode<br />
					These girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors<br />
					When they oughta keep their eyes on the road<br />
					I mean these fucking city planners<br />
					Can't even put in a left-turn light<br />
					Don't they realize some of us have dreams to chase<br />
				In Mexico tonight?!</p>
				<p>[Instrumental]</p>
				<p>1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11!</p>
				<p>We'll break this town and head out for the border<br />
					Or at least a motel in Torrance, California<br />
					Like doves on the wind, we’re sailing away<br />
				Fuck, we should've left earlier in the day</p>
				<p>Come on!  Move!<br />
					Aw, why is this lane closed?!<br />
					Would you look at this guy?<br />
					I'll bet you he doesn't even have a license.<br />
					Oh what do you mean that is racist?<br />
					It has nothing to do with his race. It's how he's driving.<br />
					HEY, THE LIGHT IS GREEN!  THE LIGHT IS GREEN!<br />
					Hey, whuh nuh nuh-- Jessie!  Where you going, baby?<br />
					Get back the car.<br />
					Are you gonna walk to Baja?<br />
					Fine!  Who needs ya?  Maybe I'll just ...</p>
				<p>...pull over and go to Chipotle.</p>
