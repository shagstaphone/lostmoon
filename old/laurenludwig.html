			<h1>LAUREN LUDWIG</h1>
			<h3>Director / Contributing Writer</h3>
		<p><img class="photo float-left" src="images/laurenludwig/ludwigpubshot.jpg" alt="Lauren Ludwig" title="They don't just give these megaphones to anybody." width="150" height="113">Lauren Ludwig is a director, writer and performer who splits her time between the Lost Moon of Jupiter and Los Angeles.  Since moving to this coast three years ago, she has written and directed a number of short films including Lost Moon Radio's first music video.  She currently works as a Writers' Assistant, most recently on ABC's series <span class="italic">The Gates</span> (where she enjoyed penning the <a target="_blank" href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-gates/the-mind-of-mia">fictional blog</a> of the character "Mia") and <span class="italic">Missing</span>.  Before heading west, Lauren worked in Chicago where she founded and ran the theater company Big Theater.  With them, she performed in a number of productions including <span class="italic">Borders of Paradise</span> and <span class="italic">Contents May Be Extremely Hot</span>, which she co-wrote.  Lauren also adapted and directed Kurt Vonnegut’s <span class="italic">Welcome to The Monkey House</span>, named a “Critic’s Choice” by the Chicago Reader. In 2006, Lauren was the recipient of a University of Chicago Summer Residency, through which she developed a play about the life and art of Charlie Chaplin.  <span class="italic">15 Tramps</span> went on to be performed at Northwestern University’s National High School Institute the following summer.  Just before striking out for LA, Lauren co-wrote and performed the eponymous role in the pilot <span class="italic">Fang!</span>, a “Finalist” in the Chicago Comedy Pilot Competition 2007.  She likes to cite it as a key forerunner of the current vampire trend.
